# Scrapbooking Android App
First android application I've created. It is a basic scrapbook app that has a collection of preset images, and when clicked, they give a description of the location. This
project is for CSC475, Platform Based Development, which is an Android development focused class.

## Current Features
* Clickable buttons that navigate the user to different menus
* Menu Bar with a back button to navigate to previous screens
* A Floating Action Button (FAB) that currently doesn't do anything (yet)
* A settings menu that doesn't do anything (yet)
* AI driven descriptions for each location!
